# RAG Application Architecture

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application is a modern web application that combines the power of large language models with efficient document processing and storage capabilities. The application is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and deployable across different environments.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (Streamlit)
- **Purpose**: User interface for document upload, analysis, and querying
- **Features**:
  - Document upload and processing
  - Interactive query interface
  - Real-time response streaming
  - Document visualization
  - Session state management

### 2. Backend Services
#### 2.1 RAG Application Service
- **Purpose**: Main application logic and API handling
- **Components**:
  - Document processing pipeline
  - Query processing engine
  - LLM integration (SambaNova)
  - Vector search integration
  - WebSocket communication

#### 2.2 Qdrant Service
- **Purpose**: Vector database for document storage and retrieval
- **Features**:
  - Document chunk storage
  - Vector similarity search
  - Metadata management
  - Data persistence

### 3. Infrastructure
#### 3.1 Local Development
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Local volume mounts for development
- Hot-reload support
- Debug logging

#### 3.2 Production (AWS)
- ECS Fargate for container orchestration
- ECR for container registry
- CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- SSM for secrets management
- IAM for security

## Data Flow

1. **Document Processing**:
   ```
   Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → Storage
   ```

2. **Query Processing**:
   ```
   Query → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → LLM Processing → Response
   ```

3. **WebSocket Communication**:
   ```
   Client → WebSocket → Streamlit → LLM → Streamlit → Client
   ```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- IAM roles for AWS services
- SSM for secrets management
- VPC security groups
- Network ACLs

### 2. Data Security
- Encrypted storage
- Secure communication (HTTPS/WSS)
- API key management
- Access control

## Monitoring & Logging

### 1. Application Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Log rotation
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring
- CloudWatch metrics
- Health checks
- Resource utilization
- Cost tracking

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Local Development
```
