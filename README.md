   * VPC connectors
   * Load balancing
   * Health monitoring
   * Auto-scaling

### **Benefits**
* Independent scaling and resource optimization
* Isolated deployment and rollback capabilities
* Separate monitoring and logging
* Flexible update strategy
* Optimized build process for each component

### AWS Integration
* ECR image management and versioning
* App Runner service configuration
* Environment-based deployments
* Custom domain handling
* Web ACL security integration

### Deployment Modes
* Development mode with debug features
* Production mode with optimized settings
* Update mode for service modifications
* Environment-specific configurations

## Deployment Process
### Initial Setup
* Configure AWS credentials
* Set environment variables
* Initialize VPC infrastructure
* Create ECR repositories
* Configure IAM roles

### Service Deployment
* Build and push Docker images
* Configure VPC connectors
* Deploy App Runner services
* Set up domain routing
* Configure WAF rules

### Maintenance
* Monitor service health
* Manage resource scaling
* Handle updates and rollbacks
* Clean up unused resources
* Audit security configurations

## Usage Flow
* Upload Document
* Select and upload a document
* System processes and tokenizes content
* Optional visualization generation
## Analysis Options
* Query entire document
* View document splits
* Query individual splits
* Save to vector database
## Query and Response
* Enter queries in text area
* Receive streamed responses

# RAG Application

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit, Qdrant, and Transformers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rag-application
```

2. Make the development script executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/dev.sh
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Create necessary directories (data, logs)
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Start Qdrant in Docker
- Launch the Streamlit application

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Copy the local environment file:
```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

4. Start Qdrant:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

```

## Development Workflow

1. The application will start with a login screen where you can set up your API key
2. Once logged in, you can:
   - Upload documents
   - Process and visualize documents
   - Chat with the documents
   - Manage your API key

## Troubleshooting

1. If Qdrant fails to start:
   - Check if Docker is running
   - Verify ports 6333 and 6334 are available
   - Check Docker logs: `docker logs rag-qdrant-local`

2. If the application fails to start:
   - Check the logs in `logs/app.log`
   - Verify your API key is set correctly
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
